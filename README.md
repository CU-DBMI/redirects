## How to edit

1. Add/change/remove redirect entries in one or more [`.yaml` files in the top folder](../../blob/main/redirects.yaml).
   Note: the `from` field is **case-insensitive**.
2. Commit the changes to the `main` branch.
3. Changes should take effect automatically within a minute or so.
   Verify that no errors occurred in the automatic process here: [![Encode and deploy](../../actions/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/deploy.yaml)

You can do this [directly on github.com](../../edit/main/redirects.yaml) (tip: press <kbd>.</kbd> right now), or locally with git.

## Motivation

You've likely heard of services like [Bitly](https://bitly.com/), [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/), [Rebrandly](https://www.rebrandly.com/), and [others](https://zapier.com/blog/best-url-shorteners/).
They allow you to convert a long link like `some-website.com/a-long-url?search=a-bunch-of-characters` into a shorter one like `bit.ly/98K8eH`.
When someone visits the shorter link, the service automatically "redirects" them to the longer one.
You can think of it like a shortcut.

These services usually offer several other features that you probably want too:

- You can customize the text after the `/`, giving you a url that a human could actually remember and type in manually, like `bit.ly/MyCoolLink` (some call these "back-halves").
- You can set up a custom domain to brand your links the way you want, giving you an even nicer and easier-to-use link, like `my-website.com/MyCoolLink`.
- You can see how many and what kinds of people have used the link over time (i.e. analytics).

This all sounds great, so what's the problem?
Well namely: **they hide or limit a lot of this functionality behind a paywall.**
Bitly, the de facto standard, [is especially quite expensive](https://bitly.com/pages/pricing).
While you may be able to find one that gives you most or all of what you want for free right now, free plans have generally become more and more limited over time.

Paying for a plan may not be a problem for you, especially if you value the convenience of having a simple service that handles everything automatically.
But with just a little bit of setup, we can accomplish all of this in a much better way.
Well, at least much better-suited to the _target audience of this approach_: **people/organizations who use GitHub and Git**.

## Comparison

Here's how this approach compares to Bitly and similar services.

**The benefits**:

- Free(er)!
  You only need to pay for a custom domain name, if you want.
- Not subject to the pricing whims of Bitly or similar services.
  Pricing and features should remain the same.
- Uses tools and workflows you're already accustomed to and ideally prefer (assuming you're in the target audience mentioned above).
  You don't need to create a new account just for this purpose, like you do for e.g. Bitly.
- Multiple accounts can collaborate on the same set of links.
  Many url shortening services don't offer this, or only offer it at enterprise-level pricing.
- You get a nice git history of all of your links; who changed what and when.
- You can use whatever analytics service you want, e.g. Google Analytics.
- You're in complete control.
  With a bit of coding knowledge, you can customize it any way you'd like.
  All of the code has detailed comments and is written to be flexible/editable.

**The equivalent**:

- Adding/changing/removing links is quick, convenient, and automatic.
- You can customize the text of your links fully, both the domain and the part after the `/`.
- You can track analytics for your links.
- You can restrict who can see and edit the links.
- You can organize your links and add comments however you want to make maintenance easier.
- You have to pay if you want a custom domain.
- People can't use web searches to find private info like Zoom room urls.

**The downsides**:

- More setup.
- Your redirect lists are not truly 100% hidden from the public[^1].
- Editing YAML is slightly harder than typing in textboxes, so you could accidentally break the formatting.
- If things go wrong, you have to troubleshoot it yourself or ask for help.

## How it works

You have a private _redirects_ GitHub repository that contains your redirect lists as [`.yaml`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files.
This is how you specify where you want to redirect from and to.
You choose who can see or edit these lists using GitHub's permission settings.

You also have a public _website_ GitHub repository that hosts a barebones [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website.
This is what actually performs the redirecting when a user visits a link.
You can set this website up at a custom domain to make your links shorter and nicer.

After the one-time setup, **all you have to do is edit the `.yaml` files, and everything else updates automatically**, within a minute or so.

</p>

Adding/removing/changing a link goes like this:

1. You change one or more of the `.yaml` files in the _redirects repo_.
2. `deploy.yaml` tells [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) that any time someone commits a change to the repo, it should automatically run the `encode.js` script.
3. The `encode.js` script combines all of your `.yaml` files into one, and encodes it into a format that isn't searchable or human-readable[^1].
4. `deploy.yaml` then tells GitHub to take the result of the `encode.js` script and commit it to the `redirect.js` script in the _website repo_.
5. In the _website repo_, GitHub Pages detects a change in the `redirect.js` script, and updates the website.

Then, a user visiting a link goes like this:

1. They navigate to a link on the website, e.g. `/chatroom`.
2. `chatroom.html` isn't a file in the _website repo_, and thus isn't a page on the website, so GitHub loads [`404.html`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) for the user instead (but preserves the `/chatroom` url).
   This file immediately runs some scripts.
3. The analytics code snippet sends[^2] stats like url, IP, date, time, location, etc. off to Google Analytics or whoever.
4. The `redirect.js` script decodes the redirect lists previously encoded from the _redirects repo_, finds the long url corresponding to "chatroom" (**case-insensitive**), and navigates there instead.
5. They arrive at the intended destination, e.g. `zoom.us/j/12345abcdef`, with virtually no perceptible delay.

## Setup

### Set up repos

1. [Fork the _redirects repo_](../../fork) (this repo) to your user/organization.
2. [Make it private](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility).
3. [Fork the _website repo_](../../../redirects-website/fork) to your user/organization.
4. [Enable GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) on it with the default settings.
5. GitHub should tell you that your site is now being hosted at e.g. `your-org.github.io/repo-name`.

### Connect repos

To allow the _redirects repo_ to automatically write to the _website repo_, we need to "connect" them with a deploy key:

1. [Generate an SSH key pair](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key).
2. In the _redirects repo_, [create a new repository actions secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) named `DEPLOY_KEY`, and paste the private SSH key.
3. In the _website repo_, [create a new deploy key](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#setup-2) with write/push access named `DEPLOY_KEY`, and paste the public SSH key.

### Set up analytics

Every analytics service is slightly different, but they should all have a way to get a snippet of JavaScript code that you can copy and paste into the webpages you want to track.
Find out how to get that for the service you're using.
For Google Analytics, [those instructions are here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080).

When you find the code snippet, paste it into `404.html` where marked (above the `redirect.js` script).

### Set up custom domain

By default, GitHub Pages will host your redirects website at a url like `your-org.github.io/repo-name/some-link`.
To turn this into a nicer `your-domain.com/some-link`, you can set up a custom domain.

To do this, [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain).
In summary:

1. Purchase a domain name from a reputable service.
2. Point your domain name provider to GitHub Pages using an `A` record.
   This is slightly different for each company; they should have their own instructions on how to do it.
3. Set the custom domain field in the "Pages" settings of the _website repo_ (automatically creates a `CNAME` file in the repo).
4. GitHub should tell you that your site is now being hosted at e.g. `your-domain.com`.

### Add notes

These aren't always necessary or desired, but may help the users and editors of your links.

In your _redirects repo_:

- Add a big warning to the top of the readme like "_Do not share links here without permission üîí_", so that people who have access understand that it's privileged info.

In your _website repo_:

- Add a big link to the top of the readme to remind people where your website is hosted, e.g. `your-domain.com` or `your-org.github.io/repo-name`.
- In `redirect.js`, customize what happens when a user visits a url that has no matching `from` redirect (fallback action).
- Add an `index.html` page with some filler content like "_This website just performs redirects for [YOUR ORG]_", in case people go to the root of the website with no e.g. `/some-link`.

### Existing site

If you already have a website being hosted with GitHub Pages that you want to incorporate this approach into:

1. Skip forking the _website repo_.
2. Copy the [`redirect.js` script](https://github.com/CU-DBMI/redirects-website/blob/main/redirect.js) into the **top folder** of your existing website repo.
3. [Include it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#applying_css_and_javascript_to_html) at the top of your 404 page `<head>`, after your analytics script(s) but before anything else (so the redirection happens immediately).
   If an existing page and a redirect have same name/path, the redirect won't happen since the user won't get a [`404`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404).

If your existing website is built and hosted in a different way, this approach would require modification[^3] and might not be appropriate for you.

[^1]: This approach does not _encrypt_ your redirect list, it only _obfuscates_ it. Anyone with some coding knowledge could still figure out all of your redirect lists with some effort.
[^2]: The analytics service you're using _should_ be able to capture all the necessary stats in time, before the redirection happens. But these services are usually closed source, so we can't know for sure exactly how they work. However, in testing with Google Analytics at least, everything seems to be captured fine.
[^3]: You would need to modify the `deploy.yaml` workflow to be able to commit/push/upload the result to wherever your website is, integrate it into your code as appropriate, and trigger a re-build of your website.
